# CS250-Final-Project

User needs should be used as jumping-off points for developers. From these, we should look at the user's request and how we can best fill that request. User stories should be written to simplify the requests and zero in on the actual deliverable from the developers.
When developing programs, the first step should be planning. I will always begin new projects by sitting down and setting expectations along with a burn-down chart. Thoughout development, I will always reflect on my work and see how I can do better work.
Being a good team member means contributing my best work, being respectful to my teammates, and maintaining professionalism during development. Always providing feedback for myself and others to the team helps keep accountability.
